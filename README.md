This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

How to Run:-

Just clone the repo then run `npm i` and after that `npm run dev`.

I've used tailwind CSS for the styling and next themes for implementing dark mode toggle.
